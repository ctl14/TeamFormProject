#TeamFormProject

This repository is a signup form compiled by Patricia Au, Riley Andert, Christopher Justice and Coulter L'Heureux.

The signup form validates user input and displays appropriate messages to help the user to submit acceptable information. There are also automated tests that use Protractor to ensure that all required functionality is implemented correctly.
